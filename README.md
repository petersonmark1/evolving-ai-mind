\# evolving-ai-mind



A public \*\*second brain\*\* where I explore how AI, life, and deliberate practice shape a better version of myself.  

This repo tracks ideas, experiments, and tooling that help me think clearer, decide better, and move forward with intention.

\## Purpose



\- Capture insights, notes, and experiments in one place.

\- Use AI to augment thinking, planning, and reflection.

\- Track progress over time across life, work, and learning.

\- Keep everything open for transparency and future reference (not for collaboration).
